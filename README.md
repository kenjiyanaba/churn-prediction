# Churn Prediction Using Telco Customer Data

This project analyzes customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It explores customer behavior and builds a model to predict which customers are likely to leave a telecommunications company.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [IBM Sample Data Sets](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/)
- **Description**: Each row represents a customer. Columns describe customer attributes such as services signed up for, tenure, payment methods, and whether they have churned.

## 🔍 Key Questions

- What features are most associated with customer churn?
- Can we accurately predict churn based on customer behavior?
- What types of customers are at the highest risk of leaving?

## 📓 Notebook Overview

- **01_eda.ipynb**:  
  - Loads and cleans data  
  - Visualizes churn distribution  
  - Explores correlations  
  - Prepares data for modeling (encoding, scaling)

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Feature engineering
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest (optional if modeling included)

## 🚀 How to Run
